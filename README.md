# CLI & TUI Experimentation Lab

A proof-of-concept repository for experimenting with CLI applications and Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs) across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## Structure

The repository is organized by language, with each containing experiments using different frameworks and libraries:

### Go

- **Bubble Tea** - TUI framework
